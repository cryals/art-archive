> **"Truth is the first casualty of the Frontier."**

**ART//ARCHIVE** is a high-fidelity immersive digital dossier system simulating a secure **NanoTrasen Directorate Operating System**. It serves as a classified archive for viewing character profiles, tactical evidence, and intercepted logs with a premium, diegetic user interface.

The project demonstrates advanced **React/Next.js** capabilities, including complex layout animations, glassmorphism interfaces, interactive sound design, and a curated "retro-futuristic" aesthetic.
